Introduction


This assessment measures my capability to implement advanced JavaScript tools and features in a practical manner.

What's the Project About?


This project is a simple web application that allows users to search for data and display the results in a paginated gallery format. It demonstrates how I can fetch data from an external API, display the results dynamically, and manage pagination to navigate through multiple pages of data.

What's the Purpose?


The purpose of this project is to provide a straightforward example of how to build a user-friendly search interface that interacts with an external API. It aims to showcase how I can handle asynchronous data fetching, dynamically update the DOM with search results, and implement pagination for a better user experience.
